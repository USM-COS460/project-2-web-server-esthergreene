# Project 2: HTTP Server

# Esther Greene

This project is written in Java on the Windows Operating System.

## How to compile

Fill in here on how to compile or assemble your project. Remember you must not include any binary (precompiled) files.

How to compile and run:
javac MyHTTPServer.java HTTPHandler.java MimeTypes.java

## How to run

Fill in here how to run or execute your project.

Execution:
java MyHTTPServer <port> <document_root>

Example:
java MyHTTPServer 8080 www

Once the server is running, open a web browser and visit:
http://locaclhost:8080 or whichever port you used

To stop the server:
Ctrl + C

This was tested on Windows PowerShell, but should still work on PuTTY. Some tips for PuTTY:
Instead of http://localhost:8080, try http://<server-address, such as ant>:8080

The Ctrl + C command should still work for PuTTY. 

## My experience with this project

Fill in here a brief summary of your experience with the project. What did you learn?

This project was immmense, but really fun to make. Research into the subject was important. I found it a bit challenging, but overall really neat. Definitely worth the effort. I tested everything on Windows PowerShell, so fingers crossed it should (in theory) work for PuTTY as well. I learned a lot about MIME stuff, which until now I had never used. I have experience with html and css, but I hadn't connected java files to a project like that before, so that was really fun to learn about. If I were to do it again, I'd say maybe keep it more simple. I think I went a little overboard. Oh well!
