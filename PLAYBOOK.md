Fill in here on how to compile or assemble your project. Remember you must not include any binary (precompiled) files.

javac MyHTTPServer.java HTTPHandler.java MimeTypes.java

## How to run

Fill in here how to run or execute your project.

Execution:
java MyHTTPServer <port> <document_root>

Example:
java MyHTTPServer 8080 www

Once the server is running, open a web browser and visit:
http://locaclhost:8080 or whichever port you used

To stop the server:
Ctrl + C

This was tested on Windows PowerShell, but should still work on PuTTY. Some tips for PuTTY:
Instead of http://localhost:8080, try http://<server-address, such as ant>:8080
The Ctrl + C command should still work for PuTTY.
