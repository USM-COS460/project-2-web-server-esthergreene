/**
 * Name: HTTPHandler
 * Author: esthergreene
 * Project: Program 2
 * Version: 10/05/2025
 * Use: Used in tandem with MyHTTPServer class. HTTPHandler reads the request from a browser and
 *      figures out what file the browser is asking fro inside the document root. It then sends a proper HTTP
 *      response back to the browser such as status line, required headers, and actual file contents (HTML, CSS, etc.)
 *      HTTPHandler then closes the connection when done (eventually).
